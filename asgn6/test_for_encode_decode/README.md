# this is the test for encode and decode
# encode and decode executables are here
# I ran encode with the command "./encode -i code.h -o code.h.lz -v"
# and I decoded it with the command "./decode -i code.h.lz -o code_decompressed.h -v"
# everything seemed normal and code_decompressed.h maintained consistency with code.h
# thus verified the lossless compression program
